description: "The working method for any code change - a feature, a fix, a refactor, or a review. Covers what to settle before writing (who owns the information, what the invariant is, how it gets deleted), how to write, failure-first design, what to test, how to do performance work, how to shape and describe the change, and how to review your own diff. Points into language references for Rust and React/TypeScript. Use whenever you are about to write or modify code, or before opening a pull request."

# Coding

The three layers, and when each applies:

| Layer | Where | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **How to think about the system** | [`system-architect`](../system-architect/SKILL.md) | Designing, structuring, or reviewing anything spanning more than one file |
| **How to work** | this document | Every code change |
| **What to do in the language** | [Rust](references/rust.md), [React & TypeScript](references/react-typescript.md) | While writing in that language |
| **How to find and prove things** | [`method`](../method/SKILL.md) | Investigating a bug, chasing a performance problem, deciding what to automate |
| **What to test and what not to** | [testing](references/testing.md) | Deciding whether something needs a test, and which kind |
| **How to describe and review a change** | [`pull-requests`](../pull-requests/SKILL.md) | Writing the description, sizing the change, reviewing someone else's |

If you are writing in a language with no reference here, the method below still
applies in full. Follow the surrounding code's idiom, and say plainly that you
had no language-specific guidance to lean on.

## 1. Before writing anything

**Read enough to be boring.** Find two or three places that already do something
like what you are about to do, and match them — naming, error handling, file
layout, test style, comment density. Code that reads like the code around it is
cheaper for everyone forever. A change that introduces a second style has to
justify itself.

**Name the thing in the product's words.** If you cannot name the concept without
inventing a word, you have not found it yet. Go find it before you write a type.

**Answer four questions.** They take two minutes and they prevent most rework:

1. *Who has the information needed to make this decision?* Put the responsibility
   there — not where it is convenient to call from.
2. *What must always be true?* Name the invariant and the function that enforces
   it.
3. *What happens if this stops halfway, runs twice, or races?* Design for that
   before the happy path.
4. *How does this get deleted?* If the answer touches more than this module plus
   one adapter, the boundary is wrong.

**Check whether the change belongs at this altitude at all.** A feature that
needs a new parameter on a core type, a new branch in a core function, or a flag
threaded through is usually a sign that the capability should be composed on top
rather than absorbed into the middle.

## 2. While writing

**Write the smallest thing that makes the requirement true.** Not the framework
for a family of things like it. You will know the right abstraction on the third
instance, and you will be wrong about it on the first.

**Do not build what nobody asked for.** No configurability, no extension point,
no generality, no layer that only forwards. A parameter with one caller is a
constant that has not admitted it yet.

**Extract on the second use, not the first** — and only when the two uses are the
same *idea*, not coincidentally the same lines. A block, a local, or a comment is
a cheaper abstraction than a function.

**Make the control flow visible.** Early returns, conditions hoisted to the
caller, no hidden global state deciding whether a function does anything. A
reader should be able to understand one file without holding the rest of the
system in their head — that is the scarce resource you are protecting.

**Put costs where the caller can see them.** Allocation, blocking, I/O, and
retries should be visible at the call site or named in the signature. A function
that silently does an expensive thing is a landmine.

**Comments say why.** The code says what. A comment earns its place by capturing
what the reader will not have: the constraint, the surprise, the thing you tried
that did not work, the issue that caused this shape. If you are about to
paraphrase the line below, delete the comment.

**Correct the name in the same change that invalidates it.** Renaming is cheap.
Living with a name that no longer describes the thing is not.

## 3. Failure first

Design the interrupted case before the happy path — the happy path will be fine.

- **One state, one representation.** A sentinel meaning two things will be read
  as the wrong one, and the case where it matters is always a retry or a restart.
- **Cleanup is structural, never remembered.** Tie removal to a scope, a guard,
  or a lifetime — not to a teardown call on every exit path, because the path
  that gets forgotten is the successful one.
- **Idempotent, or keyed.** Assume anything can run twice. Overwriting
  operations tolerate retries; appending ones need an identity that makes the
  second attempt recognisable.
- **Every queue, buffer, and retry loop has a bound** and a stated behaviour at
  the bound.
- **Write the durable fact before announcing it**, and announce before acting on
  it.
- **Decide fatal versus survivable, and be consistent with the code around you.**

## 4. Tests

**A change either adds behaviour or fixes broken behaviour. Both have a test
that would have failed before.** If you cannot write one, say so in the change
and say why.

- **Through the public surface only.** No test-only visibility, no test-only
  constructor. If a state is unreachable through the real API, it should not
  exist.
- **Real dependencies over mocks.** Mock only what you cannot run. Doubles for
  your own domain test your doubles.
- **Determinism is injected.** Clock, randomness, ordering, I/O. A flaky test is
  worse than no test — it teaches the team that red does not mean broken.
- **Poll with a timeout, never sleep a fixed duration.**
- **Minimal setup.** Strip the fixture to exactly what the assertion needs;
  anything else is misdirection for whoever debugs it later.
- **Name the test after the behaviour**, in domain language.
- **Do not test private methods or internal call order.** Those are the things
  you most want to be free to change.
- **When writing tests surfaces a probable bug, file it separately.** Do not fix
  it inside the test change.

## 5. Performance

Do not sprinkle it. Locate it.

0. **Reproduce it first.** A fix for something you cannot reproduce is a guess
   with a diff attached. See [`method`](../method/SKILL.md) for the full loop.
1. **Profile before changing anything**, and name what you found. In UI work,
   distinguish too many renders, too much work per render, too much committed,
   and work outside render — the fixes are different and guessing wrong makes it
   worse.
2. **State the expected magnitude.** "This is 1–2% of runtime, so expect 0.5–1%
   overall" tells the reviewer how much complexity the change may justify.
3. **Quantify the result with its scenario.** A number with the workload attached
   is evaluable; "faster" is not.
4. **For a pure performance change, prove the output is unchanged** — identical
   results on the full fixture set and on pathological inputs, not merely a
   passing suite.
5. **Hunt the accidental quadratic first.** A per-item function computing
   something over all items; a defensive copy inside a growing loop. These
   dominate micro-optimisation by orders of magnitude.
6. **Prefer once-and-only-if-needed** over eager, and eager over recomputed.
7. **Revert an optimisation you cannot maintain.** Whatever the benchmark says,
   code nobody can safely modify is a liability.

[React & TypeScript](references/react-typescript.md#doing-performance-work).

## 6. Shaping the change

**One reason per change.** A refactor and a behaviour change do not travel
together — split them so each can be reviewed, reverted, and bisected alone.

**Refactor, then test, then change — as three commits.** Extract the logic so it
is reachable from a test, saying "no functional change". Add tests whose recorded
output captures current behaviour, *including the parts that are wrong*. Then
change the behaviour, so the third diff is a precise list of what changed.

**Land structural work ahead of the feature that needs it, alone.** A refactor
motivated by a capability that does not exist yet is reviewable on its structure
and revertible for free. Bundled with the feature it is neither.

**Land a large feature as inert infrastructure first** — types, wiring, and the
gate, doing nothing and unable to affect existing behaviour — then one increment
at a time.

**Keep it small.** Under a couple of hundred changed lines where you can. Review
quality collapses past that and the reviewer starts skimming without admitting
it.

**Write the description with two headings**: *why*, linking the report or the
prior attempts, and *what*, as numbered steps mapped to commits. Say what you
deliberately did *not* do and why — it is what stops the next person from
"tidying" the code into the shape you already rejected.

**Name the change that introduced a defect** when fixing a regression.

**Update the prose the change invalidates**, in the same change. Grep for the
term. A stale map is worse than no map because people trust it.

## 7. Reviewing — including your own work

The full review standard, the conventions, and how to describe a change live in
[`pull-requests`](../pull-requests/SKILL.md). The short version, for the pass you
make over your own diff before anyone else sees it:

Approve when the change **definitely improves the overall health of the system**,
even if it is not perfect. Perfect is not the bar; withholding approval in
pursuit of it costs more than the imperfection.

Attention in this order: is it the right problem → is the design right → is it
correct → is it tested → is it readable → are the names the product's names → is
it tidy. Never lead with tidy.

Ask these, of your own diff first:

- Does this point a dependency the wrong way, or reach past a boundary?
- Does it put a rule in the layer that does not own it?
- Did a refactor quietly narrow a lock, a scope, or a guard?
- Is there state here that exists only to serve a speculative accessor?
- Is an obligation repeated at every call site instead of encapsulated once?
- Do two things now have to be kept in sync by hand?
- Is a claim in the description actually true — walk the interrupted, repeated,
  and re-entered paths yourself rather than accepting the answer.

**Mark optional feedback `Nit:`.** Everything without it is expected to be
addressed or argued with; the ambiguity is what makes review feel adversarial.

**Facts, then principles, then the author's preference.** "I would have done it
differently" is not a review comment.

**A stated claim is a hypothesis, not evidence.** The highest-value review
comment in every codebase worth imitating is some form of *"I do not think that
is actually fixed"*, followed by the reviewer walking the path themselves.

## 8. Finishing

- The change does one thing, and the message says which.
- A test fails without it.
- It touches the number of files it *should* touch. If a routine change touched
  four modules, that is a boundary problem, not a big feature.
- No new absence-invariant was violated (see
  [structure](../system-architect/references/structure.md#the-absences)).
- Anything expensive to reverse has a written note or a
  [decision record](../system-architect/references/adr.md).
- Names match the domain language, including in tests.
- Report what actually happened. If tests fail, say so with the output. If part
  of the scope was skipped, say which part and why — scaling the work down is
  not your call to make silently.
